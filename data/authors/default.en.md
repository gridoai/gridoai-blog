GridoAI is a Brazilian startup specializing in artificial intelligence, whose goal is to make access to corporate knowledge more efficient and accurate. We offer an innovative platform that analyzes and processes documents in real time to provide valuable insights and contextualized answers.

We believe that information is an organization's most valuable asset, but it is often decentralized in systems and documents, which makes access difficult and the search for information time-consuming and inefficient.

To solve this problem, GridoAI uses natural language processing, machine learning and data analysis techniques to extract relevant information and provide accurate answers based on the company's documents and data.

Our goal is to help companies streamline their operations, improve decision-making and boost their productivity. With GridoAI, organizations can rely on an oracle of corporate knowledge, capable of providing accurate and intelligent information both to their customers and internally in various areas, such as HR, IT, legal, and so on.
